        This homemade strawberry gelato recipe wants no eggs: just heavy cream, whole milk, sugar and fresh strawberries!
        This quick and easy preparation, with NO EGGS and NO COOKING, requires only one basic rule for its success: the freshness and high quality of its ingredients.
        
        The milk must be whole and fresh, so DO NOT use skimmed or long-life milk or powdered milk.
        
        The heavy cream must also be of high quality and fresh. 
        Finally, the strawberries must be very ripe, better if strawberries in season: they are tastier than greenhouse strawberries that you can have all year round.

        <ol type ="1">
            <li> To make homemade strawberry ice cream, start by washing and drying the strawberries thoroughly. Remove the stalk and, if present, any damaged or unripe parts.</li>
            <li>Cut the strawberry into pieces and put them in a blender or in the container of an immersion blender and blend the strawberries well, until you have a smooth puree. Check that no large chunks remain. </li>
            <li> Pour the strawberry puree into a bowl and add the sugar.</li>
            <li> Then add the heavy cream and finally the whole milk. Mix thoroughly with a spoon until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li> At this step, pour the mixture into the basket of the ice cream maker, close and start it. After about 40 minutes (the time may vary depending on the model of the machine) your strawberry gelato will be ready! Sweet, fresh and creamy. You just have to taste it!</li>

        <p>NOTE from Recipesfromitaly:</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.recipesfromitaly.com/homemade-strawberry-gelato-recipe">
            The best ice cream maker you can find on the market is the one with a compressor that cools while churning the gelato. This ice cream maker is very similar to the professional ones and is the one we used for this recipe.
