        Strawberry Gelato is one of the most popular fruit gelato flavors.

When spring comes and strawberries are ripe and super sweet, you can’t resist the temptation of a good strawberry gelato. Even better if it’s a strawberry gelato made at home!

This homemade strawberry gelato recipe wants no eggs: just heavy cream, whole milk, sugar and fresh strawberries!
This quick and easy preparation, with NO EGGS and NO COOKING, requires only one basic rule for its success: the freshness and high quality of its ingredients.

The milk must be whole and fresh, so DO NOT use skimmed or long-life milk or powdered milk.

The heavy cream must also be of high quality and fresh. 
Finally, the strawberries must be very ripe, better if strawberries in season: they are tastier than greenhouse strawberries that you can have all year round.

Now we are going to show you how to make the best strawberry gelato recipe at home, WITH and WITHOUT an ice cream maker. </p>
